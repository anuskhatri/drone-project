- NAVigation commands (MAV_CMD_NAV_*) are used to control vehicle movement, including takeoff, moving to and around waypoints, changing altitude, and landing.
- DO commands (MAV_CMD_DO_*) are for auxiliary functions that do not affect the vehicleâ€™s position (for example, setting the camera trigger distance, or setting a servo value).
- CONDITION commands (MAV_CMD_NAV_*) are used to delay DO commands until some condition is met. 
- For example MAV_CMD_CONDITION_DISTANCE will prevent DO commands executing until the vehicle reaches the specified distance from the waypoint.
